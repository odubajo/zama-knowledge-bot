# Zama Educative Community Chatbot

This project is a Streamlit-based chatbot designed to provide conversational and explanatory answers about Zama and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). It utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to ground its responses in a knowledge base built from a web crawler.

The chatbot is configured to maintain conversational context, allowing for natural, multi-turn dialogues.

###Features
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Answers are generated by retrieving relevant information from a pre-built ChromaDB vector store, ensuring responses are accurate and verifiable.

Conversational Memory: The chatbot uses a prompt engineering technique to include previous messages in its context, enabling it to answer follow-up questions and maintain the flow of conversation.

Explanatory and Conversational Tone: The bot is instructed to provide friendly, detailed, and clear explanations of complex FHE topics.

Configurable: Key settings like API keys, database paths, and model names can be easily managed in the config.py file.

# Project Structure
app.py: The main Streamlit application. This file handles the user interface, session state, and orchestrates the interaction with the RAG chatbot logic.

rag_chatbot.py: Contains the core logic for the chatbot, including connections to the ChromaDB and the Gemini API, as well as the functions for retrieving documents and generating responses.

config.py: A central configuration file for the entire project. This is where you can set your Gemini API key, database path, and other parameters.

fixed_enhanced_web_crawler.py: The script used to scrape the web for information on Zama and FHE and then build the ChromaDB vector store.

zama_comprehensive_db/: This directory is automatically created by the web crawler script and contains the internal files for the ChromaDB vector database.

# Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the chatbot.

1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. You will also need to install the necessary Python packages.

pip install streamlit chromadb google-generativeai python-dotenv langchain sentence-transformers "unstructured[markdown]" pypdf

2. Obtain an API Key
You will need a Google Gemini API key. You can get one from the Google AI Studio.

3. Build the Knowledge Base
The chatbot's knowledge base must be built before it can answer questions. Use the fixed_enhanced_web_crawler.py script for this.

python fixed_enhanced_web_crawler.py

This script will scrape content from a list of predefined URLs, process the text, and store the resulting vector embeddings in the zama_comprehensive_db folder.

4. Run the Chatbot
Once the knowledge base is built, you can start the Streamlit application.

streamlit run app.py

The chatbot interface will open in your web browser, and you can begin asking questions about Zama and FHE.

Technology Stack
Frontend: Streamlit

Large Language Model (LLM): Google Gemini (gemini-2.0-flash)

Vector Database: ChromaDB

Web Scraping & Ingestion: Custom Python script using requests, selenium, BeautifulSoup, and langchain loaders.
